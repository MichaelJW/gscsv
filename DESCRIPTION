Title: Edit Google Sheets via CSV Upload
Version: 0.1.0
Author: @MichaelJW
Maintainer: Michael James Williams <michael@michaeljameswilliams.com>
Description: Lets you edit Google Sheets cells by uploading a CSV of
    your data to Google Drive, having it converted to a new Google Sheet,
    and then running a Google Apps Script to copy the data to another
    Google Sheet as desired. Much faster than uploading cell-by-cell.
